:description: Learn how to deploy Vaadin app to Kubernetes

:linkattrs:
:imagesdir: ./images

The aim of this tutorial is to show how to deploy a https://vaadin.com/start/latest/simple-ui[Vaadin application] to Kubernetes. It is not an in-depth tutorial, but rather showing the minimum required steps to get things running and try Kubernetes as a potential host platform for your Vaadin applications.

Following the link:/tutorials/cloud-deployment/google/[previous tutorial] about deploying to Google cloud, in this tutorial we will see how to deploy it on Google Kubernetes Engine.

First, enable the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/containerregistry.googleapis.com[Container Registery] API on your project.

From the Cloud Shell, use this command to packaging the application as a Docker container. We will use Jib to create the container image and push it to the Container Registery.

$ mvn com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:build \

The next step is to create a new Kubernetes Cluster to deploy the image in. From the left menu, select *Kubernetes Engine* then chose *Clusters*.

Selecting *Deploy container* will create a simple cluster and deploy the application in one step.

From *Container* section, click on *Select Google Container Registery image* and it should show the image that was pushed to the Container Registery.

You can give the application a new name, and select the cluster zone then click *Deploy*.

When the application is fully deployed, we can do further actions such as rolling updates, scale it, or enable autoscale. We can also expose it externally to be able to preview it remotely. To do that, go to the *Actions* menu and select *Expose*.

You can keep the default port mapping with port 80, click *Done*, and under *Service type* select *Load balancer* to create a new load balancer and expose the application externally.

Google Cloud Platform will give you a static IP that points to your application, you can use it to preview the application from anywhere outside the platform. It will take sometime though for the IP to propagate and becomes visible.
