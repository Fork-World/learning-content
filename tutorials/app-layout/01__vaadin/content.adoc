== Intro
A web application can target a wide variety of audiences.
In our case, I assume a web application that is used to support internal processes in a company.
This is a typical business application, which has probably been seen by just about every developer.
The web interfaces in this area are quite often based on the experiences made with the classic desktop applications.

== Minimal Requirements
In our minimal version, we will assume that there will be a menu in the application header.
The number of menu entries is limited to four to five and is, therefore, no challenge for a screen.
Of course, on the assumption that the terms used are a little shorter than some German words, such as "Gleisschotterrbettungsreinigungsmaschine."

== The Layout
The web application layout is a frame that contains the menu header and a slot for views. 
Here we have the challenge for the first time that the navigation should not replace the contents of the entire window, only the area where the views are shown.
The following image illustrates the structure.

The views are shown in the area marked "Products."

== The basic structure
The basic framework that will be used here is based on the link:/components/vaadin-app-layout[ App Layout] component by Vaadin.
The App Layout handles routing using RouterLayout.

To start with Vaadin's AppLayout, we'll create a class named
**MainLayout**, extending the class **AbstractAppRouterLayout**.


[NOTE]
====
If you are using the following dependency, the component app-layout is already available in your classpath.
[source, xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
      <artifactId>vaadin</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

If not, the corresponding **maven** dependency is

[source,java]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-app-layout-flow</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====


The method to be implemented has the name **configure** and requires two parameters.
The first is the instance of the generated AppLayout and the second is the menu used in the AppLayout.
Based on these two instances you can start with the design.
In addition to the logo placed in the upper left corner, you can also set up the menu items.
A menu item itself is created with an instance of class **AppLayoutMenuItem**.
Different combinations can be chosen.
For example, an icon plus a description and a navigation target can be used, or a definition of an ActionListener instead of a navigation target.

[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends AbstractAppRouterLayout {

  private static final String LOGO_PNG = "logo.png";

  public static final String ITM_DASHBOARD = "mainview.menue.item.dashboard";
  public static final String ITM_PROFILE = "mainview.menue.item.profile";
  public static final String ITM_TRENDS = "mainview.menue.item.trends";
  public static final String ITM_LOGOUT = "mainview.menue.item.logout";

  @Override
  protected void configure(AppLayout appLayout ,
                           AppLayoutMenu appLayoutMenu) {

    StreamResource res = new StreamResource(LOGO_PNG ,
                                            () -> MainView.class.getResourceAsStream("/" + LOGO_PNG));
    Image img = new Image(res , "Vaadin Logo");

    img.setHeight("44px");
    appLayout.setBranding(img);

    appLayoutMenu
        .addMenuItems(
            new AppLayoutMenuItem(DASHBOARD.create() ,
                                  appLayout.getTranslation(ITM_DASHBOARD) ,
                                  DashboardView.NAV) ,
            new AppLayoutMenuItem(USER.create() ,
                                  appLayout.getTranslation(ITM_PROFILE) ,
                                  ProfileView.NAV) ,
            new AppLayoutMenuItem(TRENDING_UP.create() ,
                                  appLayout.getTranslation(ITM_TRENDS) ,
                                  TrendsView.NAV) ,
            new AppLayoutMenuItem(SIGN_OUT.create() ,
                                  appLayout.getTranslation(ITM_LOGOUT) ,
                                  e -> {
                                    UI ui = UI.getCurrent();
                                    VaadinSession session = ui.getSession();
                                    session.setAttribute(SecurityService.User.class , null);
                                    session.close();
                                    ui.navigate(MainView.class);
                                  }));
  }
}

[NOTE]
====
This example is using the **I18Provider** from Flow.
To read more about this, I recommend our tutorials about link:/tutorials/i18n[Internationalizing in Flow]
====

To use the layout now, you have to assign the attribute **layout** with the class **MainLayout** to the participating views in the **@Route** annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = MainView.NAV_MAIN_VIEW, layout = MainLayout.class)
public class MainView extends Composite<Div> implements HasLogger {
  public static final String NAV_MAIN_VIEW = "main";

  public MainView() {
    getContent().add(new Span("Page content"));
  }
}
----

== Summary
We now have a straightforward framework of an application with a structure typical of today.
The functionalities are limited, but sometimes that is quite enough.
However, if you want a little more extensive options, you can take a look around in the link:/directory[Vaadin Directory] for alternatives or use the more fully-featured link:/start/latest/business-app[Business App starter].

I will take a closer look at a few other ones of them in the next parts of this series.
