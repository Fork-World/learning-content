This tutorial explains how to import an existing Maven project into IntelliJ IDEA and how to create a running configuration for a Maven goal. This is useful for example when using the Jetty Maven plugin that allows you to quickly deploy and run a Java web application using this popular server.

== Download an existing Maven project

You can create your own Maven project from a Maven archetype or download an existing one from the web. This tutorial uses one of the several project starters at https://vaadin.com/start which include a web application and a `pom.xml` file with a preconfigured Jetty Maven plugin in it.

Go to https://vaadin.com/start and select *Project Base*. Click the *Download* button and extract the ZIP file somewhere in your hard drive. The extracted content should include a directory with a Maven project in it:

== Import the project

There are several ways you can import a Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA. The most standard approach is to open the `pom.xml` file directly. You can do it in the _welcome screen_ by clicking *Open*:

NOTE: The *Import Project* gives you more options to tweak the import process. However, this is out of the scope of this tutorial.

Select the `pom.xml` file of the Maven project you want to import and click on *Open as Project*.

NOTE: The welcome window is only shown when you close all the projects in IntelliJ IDEA. If you don't want to close your currently opened projects, you can alternatively, select *File|Open* in the menu instead.

== Running Maven goals

IntelliJ IDEA has excellent integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn install` or `mvn jetty:run` without having to leave the IDE.

Open the *Maven Projects* view by clicking the corresponding option on the left side of the IntelliJ IDEA window:

This view shows all the available Maven projects and its build phases and build goals. Let's say you want to run `mvn install`. To do that, expand the project tree in the maven view to show the corresponding lifecycle phase and double-click it:

You'll see how IntelliJ idea executes the `install` build phase (and all the previous phases in the Maven's default lifecycle) which downloads dependencies and copies the generated artifacts into your local Maven repository among other things.

You can use a similar approach to run any Maven goal. For example, you can double-click the `jetty:run` goal in the *Plugins* sub-tree to deploy and run the web application implemented in the project you imported.

Since using the `jetty:run` goal could be a frequent task during the development of a Java web application, you might prefer to create a _running configuration_ for it.

== Creating a running configuration

A _running configuration_ is a _shortcut_ to run a specific task from within the IDE. Let's create a running configuration for the `jetty:run` Maven goal to make it simpler to run the web application from the IDE.

Right-click the `jetty:run` option in the *Maven Projects* view and select *Create 'my-starter-project...*:

For simplicity, change the name of the configuration to *Run on Jetty* and click *OK*:

You should see the new option on the top right corner of IntelliJ IDEA:

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run (or the debug) icon in the toolbar:

NOTE: You can invoke the web application at http://localhost:8080.
