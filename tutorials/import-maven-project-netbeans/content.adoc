This tutorial explains how to import an existing Maven project into Apache NetBeans and how to create a running configuration for a Maven goal. This is useful for example when using the Jetty Maven plugin that allows you to quickly deploy and run a Java web application using this popular server.

== Download an existing Maven project

You can create your Maven project from a Maven archetype or download an existing one from the web. This tutorial uses one of the several project starters at https://vaadin.com/start which include a web application and a `pom.xml` file with a preconfigured Jetty Maven plugin in it.

Go to https://vaadin.com/start and select *Project Base*. Click the *Download* button and extract the ZIP file somewhere in your hard drive. The extracted content should include a directory with a Maven project in it:

== Import the project

In NetBeans, select *File | Open Project...*. Select the directory corresponding to the Maven project:

Click on *Open Project* to complete the process.

== Running Maven goals

NetBeans has excellent integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn clean` or `mvn jetty:run` without having to leave the IDE.

When you select the project in the *Projects* view, NetBeans shows common Maven goals inside the *Navigator* view:

You can execute any of these goals by double-clicking them. For example, you can double-click the *jetty run* goal to run the web application implemented in the project you imported.

To stop the server, click the stop button in the *Output* view:

Since using the `jetty:run` goal could be a frequent task during the development of a Java web application, you might prefer to bind a Maven goal to an _IDE action_.

== Binding Maven goals to IDE actions

Let's associate the *Run project* action to the `jetty:run` Maven goal. Right-click the project in the *Projects* view and select *Properties*. In the *Project Properties* window, select *Actions* from the Categories tree. Select the *Run project* option in the *Actions* list and type `jetty:run` in *Execute Goals*:

Click *OK*.

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run icon in the toolbar:

You can repeat the process to bind the `jetty:run` goal to the *Debug project* IDE action.

NOTE: You can invoke the web application at http://localhost:8080.
