This tutorial explains how to import an https://vaadin.com/start/latest[existing Maven project] into Eclipse and how to create a run configuration for a https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goal]. This is useful, for example, when using the Jetty Maven plugin that allows you to quickly deploy and run a Java web application using this popular server.

NOTE: Maven is a project management tool that goes beyond dependency management. See https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[Learning Maven Concepts] for more.

== Download an existing Maven project

This tutorial uses a https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_an_archetype[Maven archetype] that generates a Java web application with a preconfigured Jetty Maven Plugin in it:

```
mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST -DgroupId=org.test -DartifactId=webapp -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

NOTE: If you prefer, you can generate a ZIP file with the project at https://vaadin.com/start/latest or https://start.vaadin.com. Make sure you select the *Plain Java Servlet* option before downloading the project.

The project should include a directory with a Maven project in it:

NOTE: You need https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] installed on your computer to compile the example application.

== Import the project

. In Eclipse, select *File > Import...*
. In the _import window_, expand *Maven*, select *Existing Maven Projects*, and click *Next*:

. Click *Browse* and select the directory that contains the `pom.xml` file of the project you want to import:
+

NOTE: If you are importing a multi-module Maven project, make sure you select the correct project to import. You will typically want to select all the projects.

. Click *Finish*. Eclipse will import the project and start downloading the required resources.

== Running Maven goals

Eclipse has built-in integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn install` or `mvn jetty:run` without having to leave the IDE.

The most common commands are available in the *Run As* and *Debug As* folders when you right-click the project in *Project Explorer* view. For example, to run `mvn install`, right-click the project and select *Run As > Maven install*:

NOTE: You can find additional useful options in the *Maven* submenu.

You'll see how Eclipse executes the `install` https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_phase[build phase] (and all the previous phases in the Maven's default https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_lifecycle[lifecycle]) that download dependencies from the https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_repository[repositories] and copies the generated https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_an_artifact[artifacts] into your local Maven repository among other things.

== Creating a run configuration

A _run configuration_ is a _shortcut_ to run a specific task from within the IDE.
Let's create a run configuration for the `jetty:run` Maven goal to make it simpler to run the web application from the IDE.

NOTE: If you are using https://vaadin.com/spring[Spring Boot], use the `spring-boot:run` goal.

. Right-click the project in the *Project Explorer* view and select *Run As > Maven build*.
. In the *Edit Configuration* window, for *Goals* type `jetty:run` and optionally give the run configuration a new name:
+
image::jetty-run.png[jetty:run configuration]

. Click *Run* to save the new configuration and execute it. You should see the *Console* view with the log generated by the application and the Jetty server.

. To stop the server, click the *Terminate* icon in the *Console* view:
+

You can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run (or the debug) icon in the toolbar and selecting the corresponding run or debug configuration:

NOTE: If you use the https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin] project used in the tutorial, you can invoke the web application at http://localhost:8080.

That's it. Now you can use Eclipse to develop your Maven application. To learn more about:
