In this part of the tutorial, you'll learn how to connect the `CustomerForm` component (implemented in the previous step) to the application. This includes showing and hiding the form when a row is selected or deselected in the `Grid`, making the *Save* and *Delete* buttons work, and adding a _create new customer_ option.

== Showing and Hiding the Form

The `setCustomer(Customer)` method in the `CustomerForm` class hides the form if the specified customer is null or shows it if the customer is not null. When the `MainView` is built, the form should be invisible since there's no customer selected in the `Grid` at that point. You can hide the form by setting a `null` customer in the constructor of the `MainView` class as follows:

[source,java]
----
public MainView() {

    ...
    form.setCustomer(null);
}
----

To detect when the user selects or deselects a row on the `Grid`, you need to implement a _value change listener_. Add the following at the end of the `MainView` constructor:

[source,java]
----
grid.asSingleSelect().addValueChangeListener(event -> <1>
        form.setCustomer(grid.asSingleSelect().getValue())); <2>
----
<1> Adds a listener to the `Grid`. The `Grid` component supports multi and single selection modes. This example uses the single select mode through the `asSingleSelect()` method.

<2> Sets the selected customer in the `CustomerForm`. This line also uses the single select mode. The `getValue()` method returns the `Customer` in the selected row or `null` if there's no selection, effectively showing or hiding the form accordingly.

Compile the project by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes. When the user selects a row, the data is _copied_ to the input fields. The form is now "connected" to the `Grid`. Also check that when you deselect a row, the form is hidden. Moreover, the *Save* and the *Delete* buttons should now work as well.

== Adding New Customers

Let's add the functionality to create new customers by adding a button above the `Grid` and next to the `filterText` component.

Add a new `Button` with a click listener, by adding the following lines to the `MainView` constructor, right after the `filterText` configuration:

[source,java]
----
Button addCustomerBtn = new Button("Add new customer");
addCustomerBtn.addClickListener(e -> {
    grid.asSingleSelect().clear(); <1>
    form.setCustomer(new Customer()); <2>
});
----
<1> Clears a possible previous selection from the `Grid`.

<2> Instantiates a new customer object and passes it to the `CustomerForm` for editing.

To add the button beside the `filterText` component, you can use a `HorizontalLayout` that _wrapps_ both, the `filterText` and `addCustomerBtn` components. First, introduce a new layout right after the previous `addCustomerBtn` code:

[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout toolbar = new HorizontalLayout(filterText,
    addCustomerBtn);
----

Add the `toolbar` by replacing the `add(filterText, mainContent);` line with the following:

[source,java]
----
add(toolbar, mainContent);
----

Compile the project by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes:

Users can now create customer records that are stored in the demo backend.

Congratulations! You have just created your first app with Vaadin.
