In this part of the tutorial you'll learn how to implement a reusable form to edit data:

== Adding Input Fields and Buttons

So far, you have been coding the UI in one class: `MainView`. However, you can also use Object Oriented composition and create reusable UI components with Vaadin. A _customer form_ sounds like a perfect candidate for a reusable UI component.

Start by creating a new class in IntelliJ IDEA:

. Right-click on the *com.vaadin.example* package and select *New > Java Class*.

. In the *Name* field, type `CustomerForm`, and click *OK*.

To make this class a Vaadin UI component, you need to extend an existing one. Extend `FormLayout` as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerForm extends FormLayout {
}
----

The form needs an _input field_ for each editable property in the `Customer` class. There are different kinds of fields in Vaadin for editing different kinds of values. In this example, weâ€™ll use the `TextField`, `ComboBox`, and `DatePicker` components. Define the following instance variables in the `CustomerForm` class:

[source,java]
----
private TextField firstName = new TextField("First name");
private TextField lastName = new TextField("Last name");
private ComboBox<CustomerStatus> status = new ComboBox<>("Status");
private DatePicker birthDate = new DatePicker("Birthdate");
----

The form also needs two buttons for _saving_ and _deleting_ `Customer` instances. Add them to the `CustomerForm` class as follows:

[source,java]
----
private Button save = new Button("Save");
private Button delete = new Button("Delete");
----

With the components in place, you can set further configurations and add them to the form in a constructor. Add the following constructor to the `CustomerForm` class:

[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm() {
    status.setItems(CustomerStatus.values()); <1>

    HorizontalLayout buttons = new HorizontalLayout(save, delete);
    save.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY); <2>
    add(firstName, lastName, status, birthDate, buttons);
}
----
<1> Adds all the enum values as options to the `ComboBox`.

<2> Makes the save button prominent by decorating it with a style name.

== Showing and Hiding the Form

The applications requires to show the form with the corresponding data from a specific `Customer` instance, or completely hide the form.

Showing the form requires _connecting_ the properties of a given `Customer` instance to the input fields in the form, something called _data binding_. You can do this by using the `Binder` helper class. Add the following instance variable to the `CustomerForm` class and initialize it in the constructor:

[source,java]
----
private Binder<Customer> binder = new Binder<>(Customer.class);

public CustomerForm() {
    ...

    binder.bindInstanceFields(this);
}
----

NOTE: The `bindInstanceFields(this)` method processes all the instance variables that are input fields (like `TextField` and `ComboBox`, for example) and _maps_ them to the Java properties in the `Customer` class, matching by name. For example, `Customer::firstName` is mapped to the `CustomerForm::firstName` input field. You can override this by using the `@PropertyId` annotation in the `CustomerForm` 's input fields to explicitly declare the corresponding `Customer` 's instance variables.

You can implement the actual logic to show or hide the form in a single public method of the `CustomerForm` class as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void setCustomer(Customer customer) {
    binder.setBean(customer); <1>

    if (customer == null) { <2>
        setVisible(false);
    } else { <3>
        setVisible(true);
        firstName.focus();
    }
}
----
<1> Connects the values in the `customer` object with the corresponding input fields of the form. When the user changes the value of an input field, the value is set in the corresponding instance variable of the `customer` object.

<2> When the `customer` is null, hide the form.

<2> When the `customer` is not null, show the form and make the *First name* input field keyboard-focused to allow typing on it immediately.

== Implementing the Save and Delete Actions

Since the save and the delete actions require updating the list of customers in the `MainView` class, you'll need a reference to this class. You can receive it in the constructor as follows:

[source,java]
----
private MainView mainView;

public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    this.mainView = mainView;

    ...
}
----

Additionally, the save and the delete actions need the `CustomerService`. Add it to the `CustomerForm` class as follows:

[source,java]
----
private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
----

With the `service` and `mainView` variables in place, you can implement the save action in the following way:

[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    ...

    save.addClickListener(event -> save());
}

...

private void save() {
    Customer customer = binder.getBean(); <1>
    service.save(customer); <2>
    mainView.updateList(); <3>
    setCustomer(null); <4>
}
----
<1> Gets the `customer` instance that was bound to the input fields of the form.

<2> Performs the save action in the backend.

<3> Updates the list of customers in the main view.

<4> Hides this form.

Similarly, you can implement the delete action as follows:

[source,java]
----
public CustomerForm(MainView mainView) {
    ...
    delete.addClickListener(event -> delete());
}

...

private void delete() {
    Customer customer = binder.getBean();
    service.delete(customer);
    mainView.updateList();
    setCustomer(null);
}
----

NOTE: For a truly re-usable form component in a real-life project, you should introduce an interface to avoid coupling with the `MainView` class. Alternatively, you could use an event system, like CDI events, to completely decouple the components. For simplicity, we left this out of the scope of this tutorial.

== Adding the Form to the Main View

Let's add the form to the main view. Start by adding the form as an instance variable in the `MainView` class:

[source, java]
----
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    ...
    private CustomerForm form = new CustomerForm(this);

    ...
}
----

To display the form to the right of the `Grid` in the `MainView` class, you can introduce a `HorizontalLayout` to _wrap_ the `grid` and the `customerForm` components. Replace the `add(filtering, grid)` line of code with the following:

[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout mainContent = new HorizontalLayout(grid, form);
mainContent.setSizeFull();
grid.setSizeFull();

add(filtering, mainContent);
----

Compile the project by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes:

WARNING: The *Save* and *Delete* buttons don't work at this point, but you'll fix that in the next part of the tutorial.
