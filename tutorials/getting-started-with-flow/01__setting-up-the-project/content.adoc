In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your first Java web application using https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin].

All you need is basic programming skills, an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE^] such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA[IntelliJ IDEA], and the https://jdk.java.net[JDK] version 8 or later. You'll need 20 to 60 minutes to complete the whole tutorial, depending on your current experience.

== Overview

You'll build a simple application to manage data about customers. For simplicity, the application doesn't connect to a real database but uses an in-memory back end instead. The concepts you learn will help you to understand how to use a real-world back end using the persistence technology of your choice.

At the end of the tutorial, you'll get a web page with a table (called a _Grid_ in Vaadin) with filtering capabilities and functionality to add, delete and update customer data:

You can use the resulting application as a starting point for more experiments with Vaadin. For example, you could add new views, create a custom theme, use add-ons, and optimize for mobile.

If you don't want to code the application from scratch, you can
https://github.com/vaadin/tutorial/tree/vaadin10+[download the final application^] and experiment with it.

== Installing the Development Tools

Make sure that you have the JDK version 8 or later installed and that it is up to date.

TIP: Most *Linux* distributions can use package managers to install the JDK. *Windows* and *Mac* users can download the JDK from https://jdk.java.net[jdk.java.net].

This tutorial uses https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], but you can use any other Java IDE.

If you prefer to use Eclipse or NetBeans, see the following resources:

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans

== Creating the Project

The easiest way to create a new Vaadin project is by using the _Project Base starter_.

NOTE: A _starter_ is a ready-to-use project stub that includes configuration, dependencies, and example code.

Follow these steps to generate a new Vaadin project:

. Go to https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base.

. Enter the following in the *Get Started* form:

** *Group ID*: `com.vaadin.example`.

** *App Name*: `webapp`.

. Click *Download* and extract the `webapp.zip` file. If the button is not active, you may need to log in.

Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA by following these steps:

. In IntelliJ IDEA, click the *Open* option in the _welcome window_ or select *File* > *Open*.

. Select the `pom.xml` file that you can find inside the `webapp` directory.

. Click *Open* and *Open as Project* when prompted.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the required dependencies and build the project.

NOTE: If this is your first Vaadin app, building the project might take a while, depending on the speed of your network, as libraries are downloaded. Maven caches them on your local file system. Creating your next Maven-based Vaadin project will be much faster.

=== The Generated Project Files

Let's take a look at some of the generated files:

* `webapp/pom.xml`: This file defines the project. It contains the configuration to build the project and declares the required dependencies (external libraries). The `pom.xml` file is the way Maven represents a software project. Don't worry if you don't have experience with Maven, most of the IDEs make it straightforward to use it.

* `webapp/src/main/java`: This directory contains the Java code organized in packages. There's only one package at this point: `com.vaadin.example`. Inside this package you'll find the `MainView.java` fileâ€“a Java class that implements the web user interface using Vaadin:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * The main view contains a text field for getting the user name and a button
 * that shows a greeting message in a notification.
 */
@Route("")
@PWA(name = "Project Base for Vaadin", shortName = "Project Base")
@CssImport("./styles/shared-styles.css")
@CssImport(value = "./styles/vaadin-text-field-styles.css", themeFor = "vaadin-text-field")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        // Use TextField for standard text input
        TextField textField = new TextField("Your name");

        // Button click listeners can be defined as lambda expressions
        GreetService greetService = new GreetService();
        Button button = new Button("Say hello",
                e -> Notification.show(greetService.greet(textField.getValue())));

        // Theme variants give you predefined extra styles for components.
        // Example: Primary button is more prominent look.
        button.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);

        // You can specify keyboard shortcuts for buttons.
        // Example: Pressing enter in this view clicks the Button.
        button.addClickShortcut(Key.ENTER);

        // Use custom CSS classes to apply styling. This is defined in shared-styles.css.
        addClassName("centered-content");

        add(textField, button);
    }
}
----
** The `@Route` annotation tells Vaadin to direct the root URL to this view. The URL parameter is optional and is derived from the class name, if not given.

** The `@PWA` annotation tells Vaadin to activate automatic https://vaadin.com/pwa[PWA^] features. This annotation is optional.

** The `@CssImport` Imports a CSS file that are mentioned in the paranthesis.

** The view extends `VerticalLayout` which shows components vertically.

** The `MainView` constructor:

*** Creates a text field to enter user's name.

*** Creates a button with the text *Say hello* on it to send a greeting message.

*** GreetService that has a method and it checks if the user has filled the text field or is an anonymous user.

*** Adds a click listener (using a lambda expression) that shows a https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-notification[notification] when the user clicks the button.

*** Adds the text field and the button to the `VerticalLayout`.

=== Running the Application

To run the application, click on the *Maven* view and look for the *jetty:run* _Maven goal_:

image::jetty-run.png[jetty:run Maven goal]

Double-click *jetty:run* to build the app and deploy it to a Jetty server. Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in the browser.

[NOTE]
You can make changes to the code, and compile the project by selecting the *Build > Build Project* option in IntelliJ IDEA. The Jetty server picks up the changes and deploys them automatically within a few seconds. You can also reload the page to reflect the changes.

[TIP]
To make the deployment cycle smoother, many Java developers use http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/[JRebel] (commercial JVM agent) or similar to allow smooth hot-code replacement.

If you want to use _break points_ in your code, start the server in _debug mode_. You can do this by right-clicking the *jetty:run* option and selecting *Debug 'webapp [jetty:run]'* option.
