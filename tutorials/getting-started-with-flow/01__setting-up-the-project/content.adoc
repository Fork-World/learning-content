In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your first Java web application using https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin].

All you need is basic programming skills, an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE^] such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA[IntelliJ IDEA], and the https://jdk.java.net[JDK] version 8 or later. You'll need 20 to 60 minutes to complete the whole tutorial, depending on your current experience.

== Overview

You'll build a simple application to manage data about customers. For simplicity, the application doesn't connect to a real database but use an in-memory back end instead. This, however, will allow you to understand how to use a real-world back end using the persistence technology of your choice.

At the end of the tutorial, you'll get a web page with a table (called a _Grid_ in Vaadin) with filtering capabilities and functionality to add, delete and update customer data:

You can use the resulting application as a starting point for more experiments with Vaadin. For example, you could add new views, create a custom theme, use add-ons, and optimize for mobile.

If you don't want to code the application from scratch, you can
https://github.com/vaadin/tutorial/tree/vaadin10+[download the final application^] and experiment with it.

== Installing the Development Tools

Make sure that you have the JDK version 8 or later installed and that it is up to date.

TIP: Most *Linux* distributions can use package managers to install the JDK. *Windows* and *Mac* users can download the JDK from https://jdk.java.net[jdk.java.net].

This tutorial uses https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], but you can use any other Java IDE.

== Creating the Project

The easiest way to create a new Vaadin project is by using the _Project Base starter_.

NOTE: A _starter_ is a ready-to-use project stub that includes configuration, dependencies, and example code.

Follow these steps to generate a new Vaadin project:

. Go to https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base.

. Enter the following in the *Get Started* form:

** *Group ID*: `com.vaadin.example`.

** *App Name*: `webapp`.

. Click *Download* and extract the `webapp.zip` file. If the button is not active, you may need to log in.

Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA by following these steps:

. In IntelliJ IDEA, click the *Open* option in the _welcome window_ or select *File* > *Open*.

. Select the `pom.xml` file that you can find inside the `webapp` directory.

. Click *Open* and *Open as Project* when prompted.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the required dependencies and build the project.

NOTE: If this is your first Vaadin app, building the project might take a while, depending on the speed of your network, as libraries are downloaded. Maven caches them on your local file system. Creating your next Maven-based Vaadin project will be much faster.

If you prefer to use Eclipse or NetBeans, see the following resources:

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans

=== The Generated Project Files

Let's take a look at some of the generated files:

* `webapp/pom.xml`: This file defines the project. It contains the configuration to build the project and declares the required dependencies (external libraries). The `pom.xml` file is the way Maven represents a software project. Don't worry if you don't have experience with Maven, most of the IDEs make it straightforward to use it.

* `webapp/src/main/java`: This directory contains the Java code organized in packages. There's only one package at this point: `com.vaadin.example`. Inside this package you'll find the `MainView.java` fileâ€“a Java class that implements the web user interface using Vaadin:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * The main view contains a button and a click listener.
 */
@Route("") <1>
@PWA(name = "Project Base for Vaadin Flow", shortName = "Project Base") <2>
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout { <3>

    public MainView() {
        Button button = new Button("Click me", <4>
                event -> Notification.show("Clicked!")); <5>
        add(button); <6>
    }
}
----
<1> Tells Vaadin to direct the root URL to this view. The URL parameter is optional and will be derived from the class name if not given.

<2> Tells Vaadin to activate automatic https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps[PWA] features. This annotation is optional.

<3> Makes this view a `VerticalLayout` which shows components vertically.

<4> Creates a button with the text `Click me` on it.

<5> Adds a _click listener_ (using a Java lambda expression) that shows a notification when the user clicks the button.

<6> Adds the button to the `VerticalLayout`.

=== Running the Application

To run the application, click on the *Maven* view and look for the *jetty:run* _Maven goal_:

image::jetty-run.png[jetty:run Maven goal]

Double-click *jetty:run* to build the app and deploy it to a Jetty server. Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in the browser.

[NOTE]
You can make changes to the code, and compile the project by selecting the *Build > Build Project* option in IntelliJ IDEA. The Jetty server picks up the changes and deploys them automatically within a few seconds. You can also reload the page to reflect the changes.

[TIP]
To make the deployment cycle smoother, many Java developers use http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/[JRebel] (commercial JVM agent) or similar to allow smooth hot-code replacement.

If you want to use _break points_ in your code, start the server in _debug mode_. You can do this by right-clicking the *jetty:run* option and selecting *Debug 'webapp [jetty:run]'* option.
