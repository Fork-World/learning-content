In this part of the tutorial, you'll learn how to display data in a `Grid` component.

== Adding the domain objects

Before getting into actual web development with Vaadin, we need to add the necessary _domain objects_ and a _dummy back end_.

Copy or download the following three Java classes from GitHub and add them to your project:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/CustomerStatus.java[`CustomerStatus.java`^]: This is a simple enum type.

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/Customer.java[`Customer.java`^]: This this is the main domain objectâ€“ a basic _Java bean_ that encapsulates data about a customer.

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/CustomerService.java[`CustomerService.java`^]: This is a simple service class that you can use to get and save `Customer` instances. Think of this class as the entry point to a dummy database.

[TIP]
A fast way to copy classes in IntelliJ IDEA is to use the clipboard. In the browser, select the content of the file and choose *Edit > Copy*. In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click `com.vaadin.example` in the *Project*` view and select the *Paste* option. IntelliJ IDEA is smart enough to create a properly-named Java file automatically.

NOTE: The actual implementation of these classes is not relevant for this tutorial, but feel free to explore them. In a real-world application, you would most likely have something similar but implemented with JPA and EJB, or Spring-managed beans, for example.

== Showing data in a Grid

When building user interfaces (UI) for data-centric applications, you frequently start by listing data from a backend. Vaadin offers several components and ways to do this. This tutorial uses the `Grid` component to present data in a tabular fashion. The data comes from the _dummy backend_ you added in the previous section.

In the `MainView` class, add a reference to the `CustomerService` and introduce an instance variable of type `Grid` as follows:

[source, java]
----
...
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
    private Grid<Customer> grid = new Grid<>(Customer.class);

    public MainView() {
        ...
    }
}
----

[TIP]
You can fix the compilation errors shown in red using the kbd:[Alt+Enter] shortcut (kbd:[Option+Enter] on Mac). Position the cursor right after the error in red (for example `Grid`) and use the shortcut. Make sure you choose the correct class from the `com.vaadin` package.

The `Grid` component uses columns and rows to show data. Let's start by configuring the columns. Replace the constructor of the `MainView` class with the following:

[source,java]
----
...
    public MainView() {
        grid.setColumns("firstName", "lastName", "status"); <1>

        add(grid); <2>

        setSizeFull(); <3>
    }
...
----
<1> Configures the `Grid` to show the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `status` properties of the `Customer` class.

<2> Adds the `Grid` to the `VerticalLayout`.

<3> Sets the height and width of the `VerticalLayout` to 100% to use all the space available in the browser.

TIP: You can alternatively use the `addColumn(ValueProvider)` method to add columns in a type-safe manner. For example, to add a column for the `firstName` property, call `grid.addColumn(Customer::getFirstName)`.

At this point, the `Grid` columns are ready but there are no rows yet. To add them, use the `setItems(Customer...)` method. Since you have to refresh the rows later in this tutorial, it makes sense to create a method for this and call it from the constructor as follows:

[source,java]
----
...
    public MainView() {
        ...

        updateList();
    }

    public void updateList() {
        grid.setItems(service.findAll());
    }
...
----

Compile the project by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes:
