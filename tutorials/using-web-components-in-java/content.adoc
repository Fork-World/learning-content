This tutorial teaches you how to integrate https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction[web components] in a Vaadin application.

One of the main strengths of web components is that they are universal and anyone can use them. Many of them are listed in https://www.webcomponents.org/[webcomponents.org], and we at Vaadin are listing in the https://vaadin.com/directory/search?framework=Polymer%202[Vaadin directory] those we know are valid and functional.

If it's listed in the directory then good news, you probably can start using it in your Vaadin application quite quickly. But what if it's not listed yet? This tutorial will cover those two cases.

== Install from Vaadin directory

Let's take the https://vaadin.com/directory/component/binhbbbbharrypotter-progress[harrypotter-progress] as an example, integration is as simple as adding the maven dependency into your project's `pom.xml` file.

And update maven:

[source]
----
$ mvn package
----

Then create a new Java class `HarrypotterProgress.java` with the following code:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("harrypotter-progress")
@HtmlImport("bower_components/harrypotter-progress/harrypotter-progress.html")
public class HarrypotterProgress extends Component {

}
----

The path used in `HtmlImport` is the relative path of the actual web component in the `bower_components` folder. Usually it has the format `bower_components/<web-component-name>/<web-component-name>.html` unless otherwise specified by the component's documentation, such as using a sub-folder, or a different component provided by the same component (e.g. `vaadin-text-area` component provided by `vaadin-text-field`: `bower_components/vaadin-text-field/vaadin-text-area.html`).

Now you can add an instance of `HarrypotterProgress` into your layout:

[source,java]
----
add(new HarrypotterProgress());
----

At this point, you should be able to see the `harrypotter-progress` in your project's layout as well as part of the DOM tree.

== Install any web component

Many quality web components are not listed in the Vaadin directory. They could be new components, not public, or we just haven't discovered them yet.
Also, in https://vaadin.com/directory/component/kcmrcode-sample[some cases], the web component is listed in the directory but not deployed to the maven repository yet.

You can deploy it from https://www.webjars.org/[WebJars] website:

image::deploy-maven.png[Deploy Maven]

When everything goes right, you will get the maven dependency details:

image::deployed-maven.png[Deployed Maven]

Which, in our case, translates to:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.webjars.bowergithub.kcmr</groupId>
   <artifactId>code-sample</artifactId>
   <version>0.4.5</version>
</dependency>
----

Repository propagation can take a few hours, but to be able to test the newly published WebJar right away, add this repository to your `pom.xml` file inside the `<repositories>` section:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>webjars</id>
  <url>https://dl.bintray.com/webjars/maven</url>
</repository>
----

The remaining steps are explained in the first part of this tutorial, but when you test the web component this time, you will find that it is available in the DOM tree, but shows nothing in the browser.

This happens because it's not a simple web component and it requires some parameters to work.

== Implement Java APIs

We can create a template in the constructor of `CodeSample.java` as following:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("code-sample")
@HtmlImport("bower_components/code-sample/code-sample.html")
public class CodeSample extends Component {

  CodeSample(String code) {

    Element template = new Element("template");
    template.setProperty("innerHTML", code);

    getElement().appendChild(template);
  }
  
}
----

And to add the component to the layout, we give the source code in the constructor:

[source,java]
----
add(new CodeSample("print(\"Hello World!\");"));
----

From the documentation of the component, we see that there are much more things we can do, such as using a theme like `solarized-dark`. To do that, import the theme URL on top of the component's class:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("code-sample")
@HtmlImport("bower_components/code-sample/code-sample.html")
@HtmlImport("bower_components/code-sample/themes/solarized-dark.html")
public class CodeSample extends Component {
  [..]  
}
----

Another thing we can do is to change the color style of the source code, to set it as Java code for example:

[source,java]
----
getElement().setAttribute("type", "java");
----

Depends on how much you want to customize the component when it comes to low-level APIs, Vaadin Flow can pretty much do everything happening on the client side using Java.

The component documentation does not mention how to reload the component with new source code, but reading https://github.com/kcmr/code-sample/blob/v0.4.5/code-sample.html[the component's source code], we see that there is https://github.com/kcmr/code-sample/blob/v0.4.5/code-sample.html#L131[a function] `_updateContent` responsible about doing that. It's not advised to rely on a private method, especially when it is not officially supported as part of the component API, but here we will experiment with how it works.

First let's change the constructor to be a public method `setCode`, and add a new line that calls the `_updateContent` function:

[source,java]
----
Element template = new Element("template");

public void setCode(String code) {

  template.setProperty("innerHTML", code);

  getElement().setAttribute("type", "java");
  getElement().appendChild(template);

  getElement().callFunction("_updateContent");
}
----

Now from the main layout, add a textarea to read from, and a button to call `setCode`:

[source,java]
----
CodeSample cs = new CodeSample();
TextArea ta = new TextArea();
Button b = new Button("Display!", e -> cs.setCode(ta.getValue()));

add(new HorizontalLayout(ta, b), cs);
----

Those are the basics to get you in full speed when it comes to integrating a web component into your Java application. Keep https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/web-components/integrating-a-web-component.html[the official documentation] handy for additional resources, and https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/element-api/tutorial-properties-attributes.html[Manipulating DOM with Element API] to learn more about other available Java APIs.
