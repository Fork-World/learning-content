The aim of this tutorial is to show how to deploy a https://vaadin.com/start/latest/simple-ui[Vaadin application] to Kubernetes. It is not an in-depth tutorial, but rather showing the minimum required steps to get things running and try Kubernetes as a potential host platform for your Vaadin applications.
