In previous parts of this tutorial, we discussed high availability and fault tolerance techniques that make services resilient to external failures. In this chapter, we’ll add _health endpoints_ and a dashboard to visually monitor service status.

== Why do we need this?

Microservices provide benefits. However, they come with costs. An evident cost of microservices is the increase in complexity. With more parts in a system, the challenge to fully understand and troubleshoot performance problems grows. Monitoring health in microservices helps to understand the overall performance of the system and detect individual points of failure.

== How does it work?

Microservices expose health endpoints with information about the status of the service. A monitor application keeps track of this data, aggregates it, and presents the result in a dashboard. For example, the `admin-application` exposes a health endpoint at `/actuator/health`. If you have an instance running on port 9101, you can request http://localhost:9101/actuator/health to see health information similar to the following:

NOTE: You can see a list with the endpoints that are available at http://localhost:9101/actuator/.

== Enabling health endpoints with Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot includes many endpoints. You can enable all of them by adding the following to your configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: "*"
----

The demo application enables all the endpoints for the `biz-application`, the `admin-application`, the `news-application`, the `website-application`, the `proxy-server`, and the `monitor-application` itself.

== Implementing a monitor dashboard

Use the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] to create a new Spring Boot application named `monitor-application` and include the *Config client*, *Hystrix Dashboard*, *Turbine*, *Actuator*, *Retry*, *Aspects*, and *DevTools* (optional) dependencies:

Open up the `MonitorApplication` class and enable the Hystrix Dashboard by using the following annotations:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableHystrixDashboard
@EnableTurbine
public class MonitorApplication {
   ...
}
----

Remove the `application.properties` file and create a new `bootstrap.yml` file with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
server.port: 8201

spring:
  application.name: monitor-application
  cloud.config:
    discovery:
      enabled: true
      serviceId: config-server
    fail-fast: true
    retry:
      initialInterval: 2000
      maxAttempts: 30

eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8001/eureka/
    registryFetchIntervalSeconds: 1
  instance:
    leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds: 1
----

Add a new `monitor-application.yml` file to your _external configuration_ with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
turbine:
  appConfig: biz-application, admin-application, news-application, proxy-server
  clusterNameExpression: "'default'"
  instanceUrlSuffix: actuator/hystrix.stream
----

This configures an _aggregator_ (Turbine) for the health stats from the `biz-application`, `admin-application`, `news-application`, and `proxy-service services.

Make sure you are running all the services of the demo application, and compile and run the `monitor-application` by executing the following in the command line:

[source]
----
cd vaadin-microservices-demo/monitor-application

java -jar target/monitor-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Point your browser to http://localhost:8201/hystrix and introduce http://localhost:8201/turbine.stream as the stream URL. Click the *Monitor Stream* button to see a dashboard like the following:

Try using all the features of the application (http://localhost:8080) and shutting down some services to see how the dashboard reacts.

== What's next?

Always keep in mind that microservices introduce complexity in order to solve problems in big applications with multiple teams. Don't discard a monolithic approach if https://dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/[you are not facing such problems].

Although there’s much more to talk about in microservices, I hope this tutorial gave you an idea of some of the key concepts, patterns, and challenges you may encounter when using them.
