This tutorial goes through the basics of themes and styling Vaadin apps
(version 14 at the time of writing).

[NOTE]
====
You should be familiar with how to set up and run a Vaadin application to be able to utilize the instructions in this tutorial. Follow the
https://vaadin.com/tutorials/vaadin-quick-start[Vaadin quickstart
tutorial] to get started.

Also, you should have a basic understanding of CSS.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[MDN has great
documentation for CSS] in case you need it.
====

== Choose a theme

Use the https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/using-component-themes.html[`+@Theme+` annotation] in the top-level router layout to choose from one of the built-in themes. Use the `+@NoTheme+` annotation if you don't want Vaadin to load any theme.

[NOTE]
Themes affect component visuals and behavior and also set global fonts
and text and background colors.

It is not possible to mix themes. For example, you can't use the Lumo theme for Date Picker and the Material theme for Button at the same time.

It is not possible to switch themes at runtime.

=== Lumo

The default theme for Vaadin. You can also omit the `+@Theme+` annotation, it will default to Lumo.

[source,java]
....
@Route("")
@Theme(Lumo.class)
public class LumoApp extends Div {
}
....

=== Material

[source,java]
....
@Route("")
@Theme(Material.class)
public class MaterialApp extends Div {
}
....

== Use global variants

=== Dark

The built-in themes come with a dark palette variant which you can
enable using the `+@Theme+` annotation.

[source,java]
....
@Theme(value = Lumo.class, variant = Lumo.DARK)
....

[source,java]
....
@Theme(value = Material.class, variant = Material.DARK)
....

Technically, it adds the `+theme="dark"+` attribute to the `+<html>+`
element.

You can also use the same attribute on any element which is not inside
any
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM[Shadow
DOM].

[source,java]
....
VerticalLayout dark = new VerticalLayout();
dark.getElement().setAttribute("theme", Lumo.DARK);
....

[NOTE]
Dark preset is not supported in IE11.
https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/issues/50[See the issue in
GitHub].

=== Compact

The Lumo theme has a compact preset which you can enable by importing an
additional module.

[NOTE]
The compact preset will reduce the font size and the sizing and spacing of all components, allowing you to place more components on the screen.

[source,java]
....
@JsModule("@vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/presets/compact.js")
@Theme(Lumo.class)
public class CompactApp extends Div {
}
....

Technically, it adds a `+<style>+` element to the page which sets new
values for the
https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-lumo-styles/1.5.0/demo/sizing-and-spacing.html[Lumo sizing and spacing CSS properties]. You can https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/blob/master/presets/compact.html[view the values from the source code].

== Use component variants

=== Built-in variants

Many of the components have built-in variants, in both the Lumo and the
Material theme.

[NOTE]
====
*Lumo variants*

You can find a component's Lumo variants from the
component's HTML examples on vaadin.com, from the "Theme
Variants" section. For example, see
https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-button/html-examples/button-theme-variants-demos[Button
Lumo variants].
====

[NOTE]
====
*Material variants*

You can find a component's Material variants from
the https://vaadin.com/themes/material[Material theme documentation
site]. For example, see
https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-material-styles/1.2.3/demo/buttons.html[Button
Material variants].
====

Those components that have variants have an explicit Java API for using
them.

[source,java]
....
Button button = new Button("OK");
button.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);
....

[NOTE]
You can use multiple variants for a single component.

Technically, variants set the `+theme+` attribute on the root element of
the component, for example `+<vaadin-button theme="primary">+`.

=== Custom variants

You can add custom variant values for components.

[source,java]
....
Button button = new Button("Button");
button.getThemeNames().addAll(Arrays.asList("custom", "variant"));
....

[[sub-component-variants]]
=== Sub-component variants

Components which internally use another component (sub-component) can utilize the variants of the sub-components. For example, while Combo Box doesn't have its own variants, it can still use the Text Field
component's "small" variant, since Combo Box has a Text Field inside it.

[source,java]
....
ComboBox combo = new ComboBox();
combo.getElement().setAttribute("theme", TextFieldVariant.LUMO_SMALL);
....

[NOTE]
Setting the attribute will remove any previously set values using either `+addThemeVariants()+` or `+getThemeNames().add()+`.

[NOTE]
To learn about the hierarchy of components and how variants propagate
through that hierarchy, refer to the
https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-themable-mixin/#list-of-vaadin-components-that-propagate-theme-to-subcomponents[list
of components that propagate theme attribute to subcomponents]

== Import style sheets

You can import a style sheet (a CSS file) either to the global scope or
to a component's local scope (shadow DOM).

[NOTE]
====
*Where to place static files?*

To figure out where to put the static CSS
files, read this comprehensive answer from StackOverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57553973/where-should-i-place-my-vaadin-10-static-files/57553974#57553974[Where
should I place my static files?]
====

[[global-scope]]
=== Global scope

The "classic" way of styling on the web. Styles defined in a global style sheet apply to all elements/components in the main document.

They do not apply to component internals, like the label inside the Text
Field component drag-handle inside the Split Layout component. This
means you can safely write global CSS without worrying about breaking
component styling and/or behavior.

There are two ways to import global style sheets: local file system
styles which are bundled with the app, and linked (from local file
system) or external styles which are not bundled.

==== Bundled (local file system)

The https://vaadin.com/api/platform/14.0.2/com/vaadin/flow/component/dependency/CssImport.html[`+@CssImport+` annotation] will load the style sheet and inline it to the application bundle during a production build (together with other client-side resources). It's
recommended for styles which often change at the same time as the rest
of the application code.

[source,java]
....
@CssImport("./styles/global.css")
public class StyledApp extends Div {
}
....

[NOTE]
Place the file in `+/frontend/styles/global.css+` in your project

==== Linked (local file system) / external

The https://vaadin.com/api/platform/14.0.2/com/vaadin/flow/component/dependency/StyleSheet.html[`+@StyleSheet+` annotation] can be used to link a style sheet without inlining the contents to the
application bundle. This allows the browser to load and cache the style
sheet separately from the rest of the application. It also allows you to
use external style sheets.

[NOTE]
The CSS rules in the style sheet are not protected from overriding
component-specific styles in browsers without native Shadow DOM support
(such as Internet Explorer 11). Use `+@CssImport+` in cases where this might
be an issue, for example when importing CSS which is not maintained by
you.

[source,java]
....
@StyleSheet("context://styles/global.css")
public class StyledApp extends Div {
}
....

[NOTE]
Place the file in `+/src/main/webapp/styles/global.css+` or
`+/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/styles/global.css+` for Spring-based projects

[[component-scope]]
=== Component scope

Component styles are scoped per component and allow you to customize component styles without worrying about side-effects to other parts of your app.

They are imported using the `+@CssImport+` annotation with a second parameter, which is the name of the components' root element.

[source,java]
....
@CssImport(value = "./styles/text-field.css", themeFor = "vaadin-text-field")
public class StyledApp extends Div {
}
....

[NOTE]
Place the file in `+/frontend/styles/text-field.css+` in your project

== Customize global styles

Let's modify some of the global font and color properties, using the
Lumo theme.

[NOTE]
See <<global-scope>> for instructions where to place the following CSS.

.`*styles/global.css*`
[source,css]
....
html {
  --lumo-font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  --lumo-primary-text-color: hsl(265, 88%, 44%);
  --lumo-primary-color: hsl(265, 90%, 52%);
  --lumo-primary-color-50pct: hsla(265, 90%, 52%, 0.5);
  --lumo-primary-color-10pct: hsla(265, 90%, 52%, 0.1);
}
....

[NOTE]
If you are unfamiliar with CSS Custom Properties and Variables, read the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*[documentation on
MDN].

See the Lumo theme documentation for all of the available top-level
properties, which affect all components.

* https://vaadin.com/themes/lumo[Lumo theme docs ›]

To quickly and easily adjust most of the global styles of Lumo, you can
use the Lumo theme editor.

* https://demo.vaadin.com/lumo-editor/[Lumo theme editor ›]

[NOTE]
The Lumo theme editor is not yet an officially supported tool and does not necessarily support the latest versions of Vaadin. You should still
be able to use the CSS it produces by copying it to the correct files in
your project.

If you want to use the Material theme, see the documentation for its top
level properties.

* https://vaadin.com/themes/material[Material theme docs ›]

== Customize component styles

=== Custom properties

You can adjust any component-specific custom properties in the global
scope, making them affect all instances of the component.

[NOTE]
See <<global-scope>> for instructions where to place the following CSS.

.`*styles/global.css*`
[source,css]
....
html {
  --vaadin-text-field-default-width: 10em;
}
....

[NOTE]
You can find component-specific custom properties from the component's
HTML API documentation. For example, see the
https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-text-field/html-api/elements/Vaadin.TextFieldElement["Styling" section
for Text Field].

[NOTE]
Most components do _not_ have their own specific custom properties.

=== Custom CSS rules

To customize component styles more freely, you need to write custom CSS
rules in component-specific style sheets.

[NOTE]
See <<component-scope>> for instructions where to place the CSS in the following
sections.

==== Stylable parts

As an example, let's modify the Text Field component's internal "input
field" to have a border and a different background color than the
default Lumo theme has.

.`*styles/text-field.css*`
[source,css]
....
[part="input-field"] {
  /* We use box-shadow for the border to avoid changing the dimensions of the element */
  /* We use the Lumo custom properties to make our changes automatically adapt to the dark palette */
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--lumo-contrast-30pct);
  background-color:var(--lumo-base-color);
}
....

The `+[part]+` attribute selector is the only one you should be using
when targeting elements inside a component. Other selectors (such as
class or ID) may stop working at any release, as they are considered as
implementation details.

[NOTE]
The internal parts of each component are listed in the component's HTML
API documentation. See the
https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-text-field/html-api/elements/Vaadin.TextFieldElement["Styling" section in Text Field API docs] for an example.

Use the `+:host+` selector to target the components root element
(e.g. the `+<vaadin-text-field>+` element).

.`*styles/text-field.css*`
[source,css]
....
:host {
  padding: 0;
}
....

Pseudo-element selectors (`+::before+` and `+::after+`) can be used in
combination with the `+:host+` and `+[part]+` selectors.

.`*styles/text-field.css*`
[source,css]
....
[part="input-field"]::after {
  content: "";
  ...
}
....

[NOTE]
The built-in themes can also use the pseudo-elements, so be aware of
potential collisions.

=== Component state

Let's add one more detail to our custom text field styles: a different
border-color when the field is invalid, using the `+[invalid]+` state
attribute selector.

.`*styles/text-field.css*`
[source,css]
....
:host([invalid]) [part="input-field"] {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--lumo-error-color);
}
....

[NOTE]
The state attributes for each component are listed in the component's
HTML API documentation. See the
https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-text-field/html-api/elements/Vaadin.TextFieldElement["Styling" section in Text Field API docs] for an example.

In addition to the `+[state]+` attributes, standard CSS pseudo-classes
(`+:hover+`, `+:active+`, etc.) can be used for both the component host
and stylable parts.

.`*styles/text-field.css*`
[source,css]
....
[part="input-field"]:hover {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--lumo-contrast-50pct);
}
....

For more detailed information about supported selectors and styling
component internals, refer to the
https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-themable-mixin/#stylable-shadow-parts[ThemableMixin
docs].

=== Sub-components

The customizations we did for the Text Field component end up affecting other components as well, which internally use Text Field. For example, Combo Box, Date Picker, Time Picker, and Select all contain a Text Field, so those components will automatically "inherit" our style customizations.

[NOTE]
Related: <<sub-component-variants>>

To learn more about sub-components and how to style them, refer to the
https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-themable-mixin/#theme-attribute-and-subcomponents[ThemableMixin
docs], which includes a list of the component hierarchy of Vaadin
components.

=== Overlays

Styling overlays (e.g., the popup which contains the items for Combo Box or Select, or the Date Picker calendar) is covered in the official
Vaadin documentation:
https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/theme/tutorial-theming-overlay.html[Theming
Overlay Components].

== Use images and other assets

Place images and other static assets like fonts, which need to be
accessibly by the browser, in the `+/src/main/webapp/+` folder and use
absolute paths in CSS for those assets.

For Spring-based projects use
`+/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/+`

=== Example

Given the following file/folder structure:

* `+/src/main/webapp/img/logo.png+`

Referencing the image from a style sheet (imported using either
`+@CssImport+` or `+@StyleSheet+`):

[source,css]
....
.logo {
  background-image: url(/img/logo.png);
}
....
