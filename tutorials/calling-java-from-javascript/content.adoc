Typically, applications make server-side Java methods available to the client-side by exposing them as end-points in a REST web service. Although this is a perfectly valid approach, this tutorial shows an alternative way to call Java methods on the server without having to implement web services. This is possible thanks to Vaadin Flow, a framework that incorporates a set of Java classes that, not only allows you to build web UIs in plain Java, but also includes an automated communication mechanism that makes calling Java methods from JavaScript  straightforward.

In this step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to use Vaadin to call server-side Java code from client-side JavaScript code. All you need to follow this tutorial is a basic understanding of the Java Programming Language, the fundamentals of JavaScript, JDK 8 or later, and a Java IDE.

== Setting up the project

. Go to https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base[this page].

. You'll see a form to generate an app. For *Group ID* type _com.example_ and for *App Name*, _calling-java-from-javascript_:

[start=3]
. Click the *Download* button, and extract the generated ZIP file.

. The ZIP contains a Maven project. Import the Maven project into your favorite IDE (see the instructions for https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-intellij-idea[IntelliJ IDEA], https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse[Eclipse], and https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans[NetBeans]). This project is a simple starting point for developing a Java web application with Vaadin.

NOTE: Don't worry if you are not familiar with Maven. Most IDEs have excellent support for Maven, to the point you don't need to understand all its details to use it. If you want to learn more about the key concepts in Maven, see https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[this article].

[start=5]
. The _starter_ creates a simple "Hello, World" application we don't need right now. We want to keep the project as simple as possible, so go ahead and delete the `MainView` class and the `resources`, `frontend/src`, and `frontend/styles` directories (keep the `frontend` directory). The directory structure should look like this:

image::directory-structure.png[Directory structure, 60%, align="center"]

Now we have a clean starting point with no distracting code. Let's start hacking!

== Creating an empty web page

Java web applications are implemented through Servlets. A _Servlet_ is a class that enhances the functionality of a web server (which usually only serves files such as HTML documents and images). This _enhancement_ could include any kind of server-side logic, for example, dynamically creating an HTML document to include content from a database. When you include Vaadin in your project, a `VaadinServlet` is automatically created for you. This servlet allows us to create a web page using plain Java.

NOTE: If you want to see where this auto configuration happens, take a look at the https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/bb472c66871cd3c2677c36ece91e6263ce020d2d/flow-server/src/main/java/com/vaadin/flow/server/startup/ServletContextListeners.java[`ServletContextListeners` class].

To see this in action, create a new class with the name `MainView` inside the `com.example` package:

.src/main/java/com/example/MainView.java
[source,java]
----
package com.example;

public class MainView {
}
----

We want to _expose_ this class as a web page in the browser. Since we have Vaadin in our project and it creates a `VaadinServlet` all we need to do is annotate the previous class with `@Route` and make it extend a _UI component_ such as `Div`:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.html.Div;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route
public class MainView extends Div {
}
----

By default, the `@Route` annotation makes Vaadin map the class with the context root when the annotated class is named `MainView`. So when `http://localhost:8080/` is requested, the `MainView` class will have the chance to perform any logic on the server side. If we wanted to map the class to  `http://localhost:8080/example`, we would need to say it explicitly with `@Route("example")`.

If you run the project at this point, you will get an empty web page. Let's confirm this by executing the Maven Jetty Plugin. If you have Maven installed in your machine, just run `mvn jetty:run` in the command line. If you are using an IDE, create a run configuration for the `jetty:run` _goal_. See the detailed instructions for https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-intellij-idea[IntelliJ IDEA], https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse[Eclipse], and https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans[NetBeans].

NOTE: The Jetty Maven Plugin is configured in the `pom.xml` file. This plugin allows us to easily deploy the web application to a Jetty server without having to install it manually.

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to see the empty web page. Nothing exciting just yet, but you have a running Java web application ready.

== Calling JavaScript

Before calling Java from JavaScript, we need to set up the JavaScript file itself. Create a new file with the name `script.js` in the `src/main/webapp/frontend/` directory and code a simple function in it:

.src/mainwebapp/frontend/script.js
[source,javascript]
----
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hi, " + name);
}
----

We need to import this file in the Java class. Annotate the `MainView` class with `@JavaScript` as follows:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
@JavaScript("frontend://script.js")
@Route
public class MainView extends Div {
    public MainView() {
    }
}
----

NOTE: `frontend://` is used to reference the directory where static resources are. This is useful when transpiling JavaScript code to support older browsers, for example.

With the JavaScript file loaded, we can call the `greet` function in the constructor as follows:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
public MainView() {
    getElement().executeJavaScript("greet('client')");
}
----

The `getElement()` method returns a _Java representation_ of the `<div>` element in the DOM. There a small improvement we can make to this line of code. We can separate the argument values from the function call and get the same behavior:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
public MainView() {
    getElement().executeJavaScript("greet($0)", "client");
}
----

Try the application now. Stop the server and rerun it (using the run configuration in your IDE or `mvn jetty:run` in the command line).

You should see the greeting in the browser's console:

== Calling Java

Now that Java to JavaScript is working, let's complete the circle by calling a Java method from a JavaScript function. First, we need a Java method. Let's implement a server-side Java version of a greeting by adding the following to the `MainView` class:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends Div {
    ...

    public void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hi, " + name);
    }

}

----

Now we need to expose this method to the client-side by annotating the method with `@ClientCallable`:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
@ClientCallable
public void greet(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hi, " + name);
}
----

To invoke this method from the client side, we need the reference that the Java `getElement()` method returns. We can send it to the JavaScript function by modifying the constructor of the `MainView` class as follows:

.MainView.java
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends Div {

    public MainView() {
        getElement().executeJavaScript("greet($0, $1)", "client", getElement());
    }

    ...
}

----
Notice how we added the argument to the function call (`$1`) and how we added the actual value as an extra argument in the call to the `executeJavaScript` method.

Now we can _accept_ this value in the client side JavaScript by adding a parameter to the `greet` function as follows:

.script.js
[source,javascript]
----
function greet(name, element) {
    console.log("Hi, " + name);
}
----

The `element` object includes a `$server` member that we can use to call the server-side Java `greet` method. Here's how:

[source,javascript]
----
function greet(name, element) {
    console.log("Hi, " + name);
    element.$server.greet("server");
}
----

Restart the Jetty server again and try the application to see the greeting in the server's log:

== What's next?

So, the circle is closedâ€“we called JavaScript from Java and Java from JavaScript without using REST Web Services. If you followed this tutorial, you might already have ideas on what to try next. You might want to try adding some CSS (you can do it with something like `@StyleSheet("frontend://styles.css"))`, or you might want to add your own JavaScript and Java business logic.

However, Vaadin is much more than a library to connect JavaScript with Java. As you can imagine, Vaadin's automated communication mechanism can be used to generate powerful web user interfaces. Well, Vaadin allows you to do so in Plain Java! For example, try modifying the `MainView` class to the following:

[source,java]
----
@Route
public class MainView extends Div {

    public MainView() {
        Button button = new Button("Greet");
        button.addClickListener(event -> {
            LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();
            Notification.show("Hi! The time in the server is " + now);
        });
        add(button);
    }

}
----

Without coding any JavaScript at all you get this HTML-based web application in the browser:
