This tutorial explains how to import an https://vaadin.com/start/latest[existing Maven project] into https://netbeans.org/[Apache NetBeans] and how to associate https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goals] to IDE actions. This is useful, for example, when using the Jetty Maven plugin that allows you to quickly deploy and run a Java web application using this popular server.

NOTE: Maven is a project management tool that goes beyond dependency management. See https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[Learning Maven Concepts] for more.

== Download an existing Maven project

This tutorial uses a https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_an_archetype[Maven archetype] that generates a Java web application with a preconfigured Jetty Maven Plugin in it:

```
mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST -DgroupId=org.test -DartifactId=webapp -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

NOTE: If you prefer, you can generate a ZIP file with the project at https://vaadin.com/start/latest or https://start.vaadin.com. Make sure you select the *Plain Java Servlet* option before downloading the project.

The project should include a directory with a Maven project in it:

NOTE: You need https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] installed on your computer to compile the example application.

== Import the project

. In NetBeans, select *File > Open Project...*.
. Select the directory corresponding to the Maven project, and click *Open Project* to complete the process:

== Running Maven goals

NetBeans has excellent integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn clean` or `mvn jetty:run` without having to leave the IDE.

When you select the project in the *Projects* view, NetBeans shows common https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goals] inside the *Navigator* view:

You can execute any of these goals by double-clicking them. For example, you can double-click the *jetty run* goal to run the web application implemented in the project you imported.

To stop the server, click the stop button in the *Output* view:

== Binding Maven goals to IDE actions

Since using the `jetty:run` goal could be a frequent task during the development of a Java web application, you might prefer to bind this Maven goal to an _IDE action_.

Let's associate the *Run project* action to the `jetty:run` Maven goal.

. Right-click the project in the *Projects* view and select *Properties*.
. In the *Project Properties* window, select *Actions* in the *Categories* tree.
. Select the *Run project* option in the *Actions* list.
. Type `jetty:run` in *Execute Goals*.
. Click *OK*:

NOTE: If you are using https://vaadin.com/spring[Spring Boot], use the `spring-boot:run` goal.

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run icon in the toolbar:

You can repeat the process to bind the `jetty:run` goal to the *Debug project* IDE action as well.

NOTE: If you use the https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin] project used in the tutorial, you can invoke the web application at http://localhost:8080.

That's it. Now you can use NetBeans to develop your Maven application. To learn more about:
