This part of the tutorial shows how to connect the `CustomerForm` component (implemented in the https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/getting-started-with-flow/creating-a-form-using-plain-java[previous step]) to the application.

== Showing and Hiding the Form

The `setCustomer(Customer)` method in the `CustomerForm` class hides the form if the specified customer is `null`, and shows it if the customer is defined.

. Initially, when no customer is selected in the `Grid`, the form should be hidden. Hide the form by setting a `null` customer in the constructor of the `MainView` class as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public MainView() {

    ...
    form.setCustomer(null);
}
----

. To detect when the user selects or deselects a row on the `Grid`, you need to implement a value change listener. Add the following at the end of the `MainView` constructor:
+
[source,java]
----
grid.asSingleSelect().addValueChangeListener(event ->
        form.setCustomer(grid.asSingleSelect().getValue()));
----
* `addValueChangeListener` adds a listener to the `Grid`. The `Grid` component supports https://vaadin.com/api/platform/com/vaadin/flow/component/grid/Grid.SelectionMode.html[multi and single-selection modes^]. This example uses the single-select mode through the `asSingleSelect()` method.
* `setCustomer` sets the selected customer in the `CustomerForm`. This line also uses the single-select mode. 
* The `getValue()` method returns the `Customer` in the selected row or `null` if there's no selection, effectively showing or hiding the form accordingly.

. Compile the project by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes.
+
The form is now "connected" to the `Grid`.

* When the user selects a row, the data is copied to the input fields,
* When the user deselects a row, the form is hidden.
* The *Save* and the *Delete* buttons work.

== Adding New Customers

To add the functionality to create new customers, add a button above the `Grid`, next to the `filterText` component.

. Add a new `Button` with a click listener, by adding the following code lines to the `MainView` constructor, directly after the `filterText` configuration:
+
[source,java]
----
Button addCustomerBtn = new Button("Add new customer");
addCustomerBtn.addClickListener(e -> {
    grid.asSingleSelect().clear();
    form.setCustomer(new Customer());
});
----
* `clear` removes a possible previous selection from the `Grid`.

* `setCustomer` instantiates a new customer object and passes it to the `CustomerForm` for editing.

. To position the button beside the `filterText` component, use a `HorizontalLayout` that wraps the `filterText` and `addCustomerBtn` components. Introduce the new layout directly after the previous call to `addCustomerBtn`, as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout toolbar = new HorizontalLayout(filterText,
    addCustomerBtn);
----

. Add the `toolbar`, by replacing the `add(filterText, mainContent);` code line with the following:
+
[source,java]
----
add(toolbar, mainContent);
----

. Compile the project, by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes. 
Users can now create customer records that are stored in the demo back end.
