JQuery was one of the top most used JavaScript library and is still really popular. This tutorial will help you to integrate jQuery in your Vaadin project, check if it's loaded and use a jQuery plugin.

NOTE: This tutorial requires Vaadin 14 in npm mode, this is the default mode.

== Option 1: Use CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Create an empty Java class.

To import the jQuery library from CDN into a Java view, add the *@JavaScript* annotation on top of a component.

[source,java]
----
@Javascript(“https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js”)
----
The following example also adds a JS execution that will verify that the jQuery library is loaded in the browser.

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@JavaScript("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        H1 title = new H1("Test Page");
        add(title);
    }

protected void onAttach(AttachEvent event) {
        super.onAttach(event);
        // executing JS should be avoided in constructor
        getElement().executeJs("if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') { \n" +
                "               alert(\"jQuery is loaded globally\");\n" +
                "             } else {\n" +
                "               alert(\"jQuery is not loaded globally\");\n" +
                "             };");
    }
}
----

Now jQuery is loaded and can be called from the Java.

You can also test jQuery from a javascript file.
Create a new file *jquery-test.js* in *frontend/src*

[source,js]
----
if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') {
    alert("jQuery is loaded in a javascript file");
} else {
    alert("jQuery is not loaded in a javascript file");
}
----

Then include the javascript file with *@Javascript* annotation.

[source,java]
----
@JavaScript("./src/jquery-test.js")
----

== Option 2: Use NPM and web pack

Vaadin 14 manages front-end dependencies using npm and webpack instead of Bower and Webjars (in Vaadin 10-13). Instead of using CDN, you can import a third party JavaScript library using npm.

The difference to the CDN option is that now jQuery will be bundled together with the other frontend resources of the application, like Vaadin components. This is a good option if you don’t want to rely on a CDN. Using CDN will however allow the browser to cache the used jQuery version and not force the user to download it again. It is safe to presume that the jQuery version will not be updated as often as the application’s own frontend bundle.

To make Vaadin download jQuery using npm, add the annotation *@NpmPackage* on top of a component.
[source,java]
----
@NpmPackage(value = "jquery", version = "3.4.1”)
----

You can find all the libraries and their latest version on this website: https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM Registry]

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@NpmPackage(value = "jquery", version = "3.4.1")
@JavaScript("./src/jquery-test.js")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        H1 title = new H1("Test Page");
        add(title);
    }

    protected void onAttach(AttachEvent event) {
        super.onAttach(event);
        // executing JS should be avoided in constructor
        getElement().executeJs("if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') { \n" +
                "               alert(\"jQuery is loaded globally\");\n" +
                "             } else {\n" +
                "               alert(\"jQuery is not loaded globally\");\n" +
                "             };");
    }
}
----


Now when you first time build or run the application, the npm package *jquery* will be downloaded into the *node_modules* folder, but it's not yet imported to the view.

If we now test whether jQuery is available in the browser or not with the following JS code:
[source,js]
----
import jQuery from 'jquery';

if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') {
    alert("jQuery is loaded in a javascript file");
} else {
    alert("jQuery is not loaded in a javascript file");
}
----


jQuery can be called from your Javascript file, but it still not available globally as shown in the following image. Also as it is not imported in any JS file, it would be excluded from the optimized production frontend bundle.

image::jquery-not-loaded-globally.png[jQuery not loaded globally]

You can define *jquery* globally in the javascript file.
[source,js]
----
import jQuery from 'jquery';

window.jQuery = jQuery;
window.$ = jQuery;

if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') {
    alert("jQuery is loaded in a javascript file");
} else {
    alert("jQuery is not loaded in a javascript file");
}
----

Now you can use jQuery everywhere in your application.

=== Difference between Vaadin 14 and the previous version

In Vaadin 14, if you import a javascript file, it will run as a Javascript module, except if it's imported from an absolute path (like CDN).

- @JavaScript("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js") will define jQuery variable as a global variable (window.jQuery).
- @JavaScript("jquery/dist/jquery.min.js") will define jQuery variable as a module variable (jQuery inside this module, globally jQuery is undefined).

WARNING: In an older version of Vaadin (7, 8, 10-13 and 14 in compatibility mode), then *@JavaScript("jquery/dist/jquery.min.js")* define jQuery variable as a global variable (window.jQuery).

== Use JQuery with a plugin: jTippy

In most cases, you want to add jQuery library to use a jQuery plugin. As an example, we will use a tooltip plugin: *jtippy* which has only one dependency *jQuery*. 

First you need to configure webpack to automatically import *jQuery* if needed for a webpack module. This configuration is very specific to *jquery*. Update the file *webpackconfig.js* on the root of your project.

[source,js]
----
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const flowDefaults = require('./webpack.generated.js');

module.exports = merge(flowDefaults, {
    // expose jquery's $ for imports
    plugins: [
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            $: 'jquery',
            jQuery: 'jquery'
        })
    ]
});
----

NOTE: *webpackconfig.js* is automatically created by the Vaadin framework the first time you run the application.

To use jTippy library, go to the npm website and read the example and translate into Java and Javascript code: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jtippy[jtippy on npm]

[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="jTippy-master/jTippy.min.css">
<script src="jTippy-master/jTippy.min.js"></script>
----

- Add the dependency of jtippy from npm.
- Import style with `@CssImport`.
- Load our custom javascript module.

[source,java]
----
@NpmPackage(value = "jtippy", version = "1.7.2")
@JsModule("./src/tippy-loader.js")
@CssImport("jtippy/jTippy.css")
----

[source,html]
----
<a href='#' 
    data-toggle="tooltip"
    title="There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.">
    There are many variations of...
</a>
----

Translate the HTML example code to Vaadin code.

[source,java]
----
Anchor anchor = new Anchor("#");
anchor.setHref("#");
anchor.setText("There are many variations of...");
anchor.setTitle("There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.");
anchor.getElement().setAttribute("data-toggle", "tooltip");
add(anchor);
----

Next, let's take a look how include the following JS into the Vaadin project to load tippy.

[source,js]
----
$(function(){
  $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').jTippy();
});
----

Copy/paste the javascript code and import jtippy module.

[source,js]
----
import 'jtippy';

$(function(){
    $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').jTippy();
});
----

NOTE: Some jQuery plugins need to have jQuery and $ define globally. So you will need to add window.jQuery = jQuery; window.$ = jQuery;


== Summary

Vaadin framework comes with the default functionalities to manage and optimize frontend dependencies but some libraries like jQuery require specific configuration of webpack in order to be used in Vaadin. Did you try to import Javascript library in Vaadin 14 project?
