This tutorial explains how to import an https://vaadin.com/start/latest[existing Maven project] into IntelliJ IDEA and how to create a running configuration for a https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_goal[Maven goal]. This is useful, for example, when using the Jetty Maven plugin that allows you to quickly deploy and run a Java web application using this popular server.

NOTE: Maven is a project management tool that goes beyond dependency management. See https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[Learning Maven Concepts] to learn more.

== Download an existing Maven project

This tutorial uses a https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_an_archetype[Maven archetype] that generates a web application with a preconfigured Jetty Maven Plugin in it:

```
mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin -DarchetypeArtifactId=vaadin-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST -DgroupId=org.test -DartifactId=webapp -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

NOTE: If you prefer, you can generate a ZIP file with the project at https://vaadin.com/start/latest or https://start.vaadin.com. Make sure you select the *Plain Java Servlet* option before downloading the project.

The project should include a directory with a Maven project in it:

NOTE: You need https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] installed on your computer to compile the example application.

== Import the project

There are several ways to import a Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA. The most common approach is to open the `pom.xml` file directly. You can do it in the _welcome screen_ by clicking *Open*:

NOTE: *Import Project* gives you more options to tweak the import process. However, this is out of the scope of this tutorial.

Select the `pom.xml` file of the Maven project you want to import and click *Open as Project*.

NOTE: The welcome window is only shown when you close all projects in IntelliJ IDEA. If you don't want to close your currently opened projects, you can select *File > Open* in the menu instead.

== Running Maven goals

IntelliJ IDEA has an excellent integration with Maven. You can run common commands such as `mvn install` or `mvn jetty:run` without having to leave the IDE.

Open the *Maven* view by clicking the corresponding option on the left side of the IntelliJ IDEA window:

image::maven-projects-view.png[Maven projects view]

This view shows all the available Maven projects and their https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts[build phases and build goals]. Let's say you want to run `mvn install`. To do that, expand the project tree in the *Maven* view to show the corresponding https://vaadin.com/tutorials/learning-maven-concepts#_what_is_a_build_phase[lifecycle phase] and then double-click *install*:

image::lifecycle.png[Lifecycle phases]

You'll see how IntelliJ idea executes the `install` build phase (and all the previous phases in the Maven's default lifecycle) that downloads dependencies and copies the generated artifacts into your local Maven repository, among other things.

You can use a similar approach to run any Maven goal. For example, you can double-click the `jetty:run` goal in the *Plugins* sub-tree to deploy and run the web application implemented in the project you imported. Similarly, if you are using https://vaadin.com/spring[Spring Boot], you can double-click `spring-boot:run` to run the application.

== Creating a running configuration

Since using the `jetty:run` goal could be a frequent task during the development of a Java web application, you may prefer to create a _running configuration_ for it.

A _running configuration_ is a _shortcut_ to run a specific task from within the IDE. Let's create a running configuration for the `jetty:run` Maven goal to make it simpler to run the web application.

Right-click the `jetty:run` option in the *Maven* view and select *Create 'webapp [jetty:run]'*:

For simplicity, change the name of the configuration to *Run on Jetty* and click *OK*:

image::run-on-jetty.png[Run on Jetty]

NOTE: If you are using https://vaadin.com/spring[Spring Boot], use the `spring-boot:run` goal.

You should see the new option on the top right corner of IntelliJ IDEA:

Now you can deploy and run the web application by clicking the run (or the debug) icon in the toolbar:

NOTE: If you use the https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin] project used in the tutorial, you can invoke the web application at http://localhost:8080.

That's it. Now you can use IntelliJ IDEA to develop your Maven application. To learn more about:
